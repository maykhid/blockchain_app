## 🦾 Getting Started
You have to have Flutter installed on your machine. To run this project clone this repository. Launch your favorite Flutter IDE and run `flutter pub get` and `dart run build_runner build` (This assumes you already have Flutter installed in your machine). I am currently running `Flutter version, 3.19.4` with `Dart version 3.3.2` on local machine. 

## 📖 Brief
This project involves creating a Flutter application that interacts with blockchain APIs to display transactions from the latest block. The application requires user authentication and involves several key features and pages.

## 🛠 Technical Note
The app connects to both (https://blockchain.info/rawblock/$block_hash and https://api.tzkt.io/#tag/Blocks) to get all tansactions in the block for both BTC and Tezos transactions respsectively.

For the BTC transactions we call https://blockchain.info/latestblock to get us the latest block hash then we proceed to call https://blockchain.info/rawblock/$block_hash with the given blockhash to get the latest BTC block transaction. This particular request can take a long time to process because of the large data it tries to pull, so I cache the response but fetch new data every 15 minutes for better user experience.
For the Tezos transactions we call https://api.tzkt.io/v1/blocks to fetch all blocks.
