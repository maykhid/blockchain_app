## ðŸ¦¾ Getting Started
You have to have Flutter installed on your machine. To run this project clone this repository. Launch your favourite Flutter IDE and run on your terminal `flutter pub get` and `dart run build_runner build` (This assumes you already have Flutter installed on your machine). I am running `Flutter version, 3.19.4` with `Dart version 3.3.2` on my local machine. 

## ðŸ“– Brief
This project involves creating a Flutter application that interacts with blockchain APIs to display transactions from the latest block. The application requires user authentication and involves several key features and pages.

**Note: To log on to the application any valid email and password would grant you access (a valid password is any alpha-numeric string with 7 - 8 characters). The app does not store any user information.**

## ðŸ›  Technical Note
The app connects to both (https://blockchain.info/rawblock/$block_hash and https://api.tzkt.io/#tag/Blocks) to get all transactions in the block for both BTC and Tezos transactions respectively.

For the BTC transactions I call https://blockchain.info/latestblock to get us the latest block hash then proceed to call https://blockchain.info/rawblock/$block_hash with the given blockhash to get the latest BTC block transaction. This particular request can take a long time to process because of the large data it tries to pull, so I cache the response, 15 minutes after the request you can fetch/pull new data this gives a better user experience.
For the Tezos transactions, we call https://api.tzkt.io/v1/blocks to fetch all blocks.
